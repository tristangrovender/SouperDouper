                nutritious meals to all who come through our doors. We feed the
                hungry and assist in our humble way to keep families together by
                providing them nourishment, clothing and education. The Soup
                Kitchen's primary responsibility is to provide a safe, clean,
                uplifting environment for those in need of food and fellowship.
